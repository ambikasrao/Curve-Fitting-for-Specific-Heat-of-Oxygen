# Curve-Fitting-for-Specific-Heat-of-Oxygen
Specific heat capacity is a measure of the amount of heat energy required to change the temperature of 1 kg of a material by 1 K. Hence it is important as it will give an indication of how much energy will be required to heat or cool an object of a given mass by a given amount.
When an endothermic reaction occurs, the heat required is absorbed from the thermal energy of the solution, which decreases its temperature. The temperature change, along with the specific heat and mass of the solution, can then be used to calculate the amount of heat involved in either case.

Curve fitting is an important tool when it comes to developing equations that best describes a set of given data points.

Here, we are using MATLAB to create a curve fit for the given set of data containing the specific heat of oxygen as a function of temperature.
